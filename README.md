# examd data visualization

In this project, we aim to explore the factors that may affect students' exam performance and understand how these factors relate to their grades. We will begin by visualizing the data on exam scores and grades to identify any patterns or trends. In the second part of the project, we will take a closer look at three key factors that may impact students' overall exam performance: standard lunch, parents' education level, and completion of exam preparation. To achieve this, we will use scikit learn to build a linear model to perform Multiple Linear Regressions and examine the correlation between these variables and students' grades. By the end of the project, we hope to gain a better understanding of how these factors contribute to students' academic success and identify potential areas for improvement.
