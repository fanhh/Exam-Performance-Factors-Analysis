# examd data visualization
A basic data analysis and machine learning project that aims to explore factors that may impact students' academic performance and build a linear regression model to examine the correlation between the independent variables and overall exam performance. The project involves using various scientific computing techniques, such as data manipulation using pandas, data visualization through plotting, and machine learning algorithms through scikit-learn.

#### Part I: running bootstrap to estimate the true parameters of the exam score based on gender and exam category via data visualization, this will allow me to obtain a more reliable estimate of the means, with a 99% confidence interval approximation. 
#### Part II: Examine on serval factors that may be assoicated with the student exam performance via data visualization.
#### Part III: Is where I am going to walk you step by step of how I use scikit learn to build a linear model and examine the impacts of each independent variables has on the ouputs. We see how much correlation with students' overall exam performance based on three key factors: standard lunch, parents' education level, and completion of exam preparation. Note: For this project I will only based the overall average exam performance for students.
