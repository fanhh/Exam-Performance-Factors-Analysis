# examdata visualization
In this project, I have set out on an exciting voyage into the realm of scientific computing, delving into the intricacies of manipulating dataframes, visualizing data through plotting, and leveraging linear regression machine learning algorithms to make predictions and examine the how much impact does each indepent variables factors in the output. To apply these skills, I have meticulously analyzed a dataset containing 1000 samples of students' exam performance, using pandas to see how much the parental education, free school lunch, and exam prep factors in academic success. There are three parts of this project: 
#### Part I: running bootstrap to estimate the true parameters of the exam score based on gender and exam category via data visualization, this will allow me to obtain a more reliable estimate of the means, with a 99% confidence interval approximation. 
#### Part II: Examine on serval factors that may be assoicated with the student exam performance via data visualization.
#### Part III: Is where I am going to walk you step by step of how I use scikit learn to build a linear model and examine the impacts of each independent variables has on the ouputs. I am going to use scikit-learn to build a linear regression model to see how much correlation with students' overall exam performance based on three key factors: standard lunch, parents' education level, and completion of exam preparation. Note: For this project I will only based the overall average exam performance for students.
