    "# Project Description\n",
    "## Xiang Ding\n",
    "In this project, I have set out on an exciting voyage into the realm of scientific computing, delving into the intricacies of manipulating dataframes, visualizing data through plotting, and leveraging linear regression machine learning algorithms to make predictions and examine the how much impact does each indepent variables factors in the output. To apply these skills, I have meticulously analyzed a dataset containing 1000 samples of students' exam performance, using pandas to see how much the parental education, free school lunch, and exam prep factors in academic success. There are three parts of this project: \n",
    "#### Part I: running bootstrap to estimate the true parameters of the exam score based on gender and exam category via data visualization, this will allow me to obtain a more reliable estimate of the means, with a 99% confidence interval approximation. \n",
    "#### Part II: Examine on serval factors that may be assoicated with the student exam performance via data visualization.\n",
    "#### Part III: Is where I am going to walk you step by step of how I use scikit learn to build a linear model and examine the impacts of each independent variables has on the ouputs.\n",
    "Please uncomment each cell below to run and see the data visualization."

As for the second factor, school lunch, we will create a binary variable where a value of 1 indicates that the student receives a free school lunch, and 0 indicates that the student does not receive a free school lunch.

However, the most exhilarating part has been diving into the world of machine learning with Scikit-Learn. By delving into the mathematics behind linear regression models and researching various online articles, I've gained a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind the model and how to effectively apply it to my datasets. Moreover, This project has also been uploaded on github as well"
