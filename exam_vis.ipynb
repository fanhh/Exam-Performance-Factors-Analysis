    "In this project, we aim to explore the factors that may affect students' exam performance and understand how these factors relate to their grades. We will begin by visualizing the data on exam scores and grades to identify any patterns or trends. In the second part of the project, we will take a closer look at three key factors that may impact students' overall exam performance: standard lunch, parents' education level, and completion of exam preparation. To achieve this, we will use scikit learn to build a linear model to perform Multiple Linear Regression and examine the correlation between these variables and students' grades. By the end of the project, we hope to gain a better understanding of how these factors contribute to students' academic success and identify potential areas for improvement.\n",

The model had high MSE values and low R^2 values, indicating that the variables we examined - parents' education, school lunch, and exam preparation - did not have a significant impact on overall exam performance. These results suggest that other factors may play a more important role in determining students' academic success. Further reserach is needed and perhaps a different model may have a better results."

    "I belived I have really challenged myself by exploring and utilizing various libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib, to manipulate data and generate insightful visualizations. However, the most exhilarating part has been diving into the world of machine learning with Scikit-Learn. By delving into the mathematics behind linear regression models and researching various online articles, I've gained a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind the model and how to effectively apply it to my datasets. Moreover, This project has also been uploaded on github as well https://github.com/fanhh/examdata_prediction"
